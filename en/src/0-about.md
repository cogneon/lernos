# About lernOS

## WHY - Why do we need lernOS?
**Constant change** and our **future well-being** require **continuous, self-organised learning** (see also [OECD Learning Compass 2030](https://www.oecd.org/education/2030-project/contact/OECD_Lernkompass_2030.pdf)). We can all feel the effects of digitally networked **knowledge societies** on a daily basis (flood of information, pressure to perform, speed of technical innovation).


## WHAT - What is lernOS?
The term **lernOS** comes from Esperanto and is the future tense of learning: **I/we will/will learn**. The basic idea of lernOS is therefore to teach individuals, teams and organisations modern methods of learning and working. To this end, lernOS provides guidelines and learning paths with which a modern attitude (**mindset**), the right skills (**skillset**) and modern tools (**toolset**) can be learnt.


HOW - How can I get started?
Many paths lead to lernOS. A suggestion:

1. choose one of the [lernOS guides](./guides). For beginners, we recommend one of the three learning paths in the [lernOS for you guide](https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-for-you/de/) on **productivity & freedom from stress**, **goal orientation & focussing** or **openness & networking** (see also [overview](https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-for-you/de/2-0-Lernpfade/)).
1. choose a **period of time** in which you would like to go through the learning path of the guide.
1. decide whether you want to learn **alone**, as a **learning tandem** or in a **circle** with 4-5 people. To start, we recommend learning in a circle.
1. use your **personal network**, **social media** or the [Peerfinder](https://web.peerfinder.app/de) to find fellow learners.
1. **Stop talking, start doing! :-)**
