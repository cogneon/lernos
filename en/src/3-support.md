## Use lernOS
To get started with lernOS, it is important to gain your own experience with the method:

1. find a [lernOS guide](/guides) of your choice. For beginners, we recommend the lernOS guide for you.
1. choose a quarter in which you would like to go through the learning path of the guide
1. decide whether you want to learn alone, in a learning tandem or in a learning group (also called a circle) with usually 4-5 people
1. use your personal network, social media or the [Peerfinder](https://web.peerfinder.app/de) to find fellow learners.
1. stop talking, start doing! :-)
