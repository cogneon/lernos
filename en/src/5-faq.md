# lernOS FAQ

On this page we collect the **answers to frequently asked questions**. If your question is not included, you can write it in the comments below.



**I want to get started with lernOS, but don't know exactly how. What tips are there?**

A good place to start is the [Community CONNECT](https://community.cogneon.de) with over 1,600 members and the monthly Community Call. To find out about the dates, you can simply register in our [group on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/lernos-connect/). You can also ask around on social media such as Twitter or LinkedIn (hashtag: #lernos). If you would like to start a learning tandem or a learning group, we recommend the [Peerfinder](https://web.peerfinder.app/).

**Where can I find the PDF, Word and e-book files for the guides?**

In the web version of the guide, click on *Downloads* in the sidebar on the left. If they are not linked there, you can try the direct link to the GitHub repository above. There you will find the files in the folder for the respective language version (e.g. de, en).

**Can I read the lernOS guides on an e-book reader such as the Kindle?**

Yes, the guides are available in the e-book formats [EPUB](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) and [Mobipocket](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket). With Kindle, for example, you have to send the mobi file to the Kindle e-mail address (displayed in the settings). With e-book management software such as [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), the epub file can simply be added using drag & drop.

**Can I use and modify lernOS content?**

Yes, you can and we even want you to! For this reason, lernOS content is published under the licence [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de) (CC BY). You can download, use and modify the content. You can use lernOS content in private and commercial contexts free of charge.

**What is the difference between lernOS and other methods such as Working Out Looud (WOL)?**

See [Blog on the most important differences](https://cogneon.de/2019/07/13/di3-13-wichtigsten-unterschiede-zwischen-lernos-und-wol/).

**Can I offer commercial products and services with lernOS in their name?**

No. Individual products and services may not include the term ‘lernOS’ in their name (e.g. ‘lernOS Lernwerkstatt’). This is like the open source web browser [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), whose source code can be used by anyone. However, products based on this must have a different name ([Google Chrome](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), [Microsoft Edge](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge), [Opera](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(Browser)), [Flock](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(Browser)), [Brave](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(Browser))).

**I would like to create a lernOS guide myself, how does that work?**
The creation of lernOS guides is described in the [lernOS Template Guide](https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-template/de/). If you want to write a guide, the best first step is to contact [Simon Dückert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simondueckert/).
